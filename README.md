# Digital Divination 
## Rose Answer Interactive Website
### by Yue(Krystal)Huang


This website's design inspiration is from my personal life. Whenever I need to make a decision that I donâ€™t know how to choose I will flip a coin or count the rose pannels. The most common divination that occurs in my life is the rose panel counting. The rose panel is randomly generated, so the answer of the YES or NO is also random. I want to build up a more user-engaging website. So I designed that when users click on the rose panels, the rose panels will fall down. I want the animation to be smooth and natural. The rose panel fall-down animation really cost me a long time to code, but I did it in the end. I wish all users could enjoy this web, and help them to make a decision!
